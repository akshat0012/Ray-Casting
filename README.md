Welcome to the Ray Casting Exploration website, an interactive platform that delves into the fascinating world of 2D ray casting using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ray casting is a powerful technique that simulates the behavior of light rays as they interact with a two-dimensional environment, creating realistic lighting and shadow effects.
I created this website as part of my journey in learning JavaScript and utilizing the Processing library.
